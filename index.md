## Thanks for visiting my page!

This has been one of the most exciting rides of my life! Computer science made me discover a love for computers that I didn’t know I have. When I first walked into a college campus, my option was only one: Psychology. Never did I think that a simple experiment was going to turn into a full bachelor’s in science. My background in computer science ranges from programming to assembly. I’ve developed full applications in some of my classes and had the opportunity to work with data using SQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I have a broad understanding of Python, C++, and Java. When it comes to software engineering, I know the different SDLC approaches that are mostly used(Waterfall and Agile approaches) as well as the organizational ways to develop software organized and correctly. When it comes to coding, I enjoy troubleshooting more than anything else. This has to do a lot with the fact that I troubleshoot machinery at work, which is mostly linked to software issues. All the classes I took prepared me greatly for this closing chapter.
When it comes to projects, I can both work with a team or by myself. I believe that working in a team environment makes the work better and faster since many hands are on. As long as there’s communication within the team, the following saying fits perfectly: team work makes the dream work. Of the software development life cycle approaches, I prefer Agile over waterfall, but this doesn’t mean I wouldn’t be okay working on any of them. Having that close communication with a costumer makes things go better since they know what they’re getting and can communicate if they need changes on something. When it comes to data structures and algorithms, organizing data for a desired study was something I really enjoyed. Not only does it teach you ways to organize data, it also shows you how data analysis can help on understanding a problem or challenge in a better way.
The most important lesson I learned when working towards my degree was the importance of security. Being able to write code free of bugs should be the main priority of a developer. Coding standards should be followed at all times to prevent issues, and in case one is found, it should be attacked at its root, so it doesn’t cause bigger issues within the program.
For this ePortfolio, I will showcase my coding abilities while focusing on three main areas of improvement: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. I’ve chosen these artifacts because they already show great design and functionality. Also, I consider I elaborated them in a way that shows how following coding standards can generate a great product.


### Artifacts Description and Inclusion

My artifacts will be:

1. A 3D Shovel(Design and Engineering)
2. A calculator app(Algorithm and data structure)
3. A Coffee Shop App(Databases)

### Informal Code Overview
